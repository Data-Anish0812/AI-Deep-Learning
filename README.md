# Customer Churn Prediction
**Customer Churn Prediction** implements a Customer Churn Detection model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving a service or product. The model leverages various customer features, such as demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history, to identify at-risk customers. The approach focuses on improving business decision-making by allowing proactive interventions, such as personalized offers or retention strategies. The project demonstrates the power of machine learning in customer analytics and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques to assess performance and interpret results.
# Dmart reviews analysis using NLP
This project focuses on **NLP cleaning and sentiment analysis** of D-Mart reviews. Using the NLTK library, stopwords were removed, and popular words were extracted to refine the text data. Sentiment analysis was performed to classify reviews into **positive, negative, and neutral categories**, which were then concatenated for a comprehensive overview. This analysis helps in understanding customer opinions and extracting valuable insights from the reviews.
# Hotel review sentiment analysis
