# Customer Churn Prediction
**Customer Churn Prediction** implements a Customer Churn Detection model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving a service or product. The model leverages various customer features, such as demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history, to identify at-risk customers. The approach focuses on improving business decision-making by allowing proactive interventions, such as personalized offers or retention strategies. The project demonstrates the power of machine learning in customer analytics and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques to assess performance and interpret results.
