# Customer Churn Prediction
In the churn prediction analysis, both an optimized neural network (NN) and a simple NN were implemented to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting customer churn. The optimized NN included enhancements such as hyperparameter tuning, dropout regularization, and early stopping, while the simple NN was built with a basic architecture and default settings. After training both models on the same dataset, the optimized NN demonstrated higher accuracy compared to the simple NN, showing that optimization techniques significantly improve model performance. This comparison highlights the value of fine-tuning in achieving more accurate churn predictions.
# Sppech to Text Conversion
Sppech to Text Conversion demonstrates speech-to-text conversion using OpenAI's Whisper library. A simple audio file is processed and transcribed into text with high accuracy, showcasing Whisper's powerful multilingual and robust transcription capabilities. The implementation is straightforward, making it easy to adapt for various audio processing tasks such as voice assistants, transcription services, or language learning tools.
# Dmart reviews analysis using NLP
This project focuses on **NLP cleaning and sentiment analysis** of D-Mart reviews. Using the NLTK library, stopwords were removed, and popular words were extracted to refine the text data. Sentiment analysis was performed to classify reviews into **positive, negative, and neutral categories**, which were then concatenated for a comprehensive overview. This analysis helps in understanding customer opinions and extracting valuable insights from the reviews.
# Hotel review sentiment analysis
This project focuses on **NLP preprocessing and sentiment analysis** of hotel reviews. Using the NLTK library, stopwords were removed, and frequently occurring words were identified to enhance text refinement. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was carried out to uncover the most common positive and negative words, offering a deeper understanding of guest sentiment. To further enhance visualization, the **WordCloud** library was utilized to display the most repeated words across the reviews. Sentiment analysis was then conducted to classify reviews into **positive, negative, and neutral categories**, which were combined for a holistic evaluation. This analysis aids in understanding guest feedback and deriving valuable insights from the reviews.
# Time series analysis on Answered calls
