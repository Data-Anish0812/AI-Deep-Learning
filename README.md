# Customer Churn Prediction
**Customer Churn Prediction** implements a Customer Churn Detection model using both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving a service or product. The models leverage a wide range of customer features, such as demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history, to identify at-risk customers. While ANN is utilized for structured data analysis, CNN is applied to capture complex patterns and interactions within the data, enhancing prediction accuracy. The approach aims to improve business decision-making by enabling proactive interventions, such as personalized offers or retention strategies. This project demonstrates the combined power of deep learning techniques in customer analytics and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques to assess performance and interpret results.
# Dmart reviews analysis using NLP
This project focuses on **NLP cleaning and sentiment analysis** of D-Mart reviews. Using the NLTK library, stopwords were removed, and popular words were extracted to refine the text data. Sentiment analysis was performed to classify reviews into **positive, negative, and neutral categories**, which were then concatenated for a comprehensive overview. This analysis helps in understanding customer opinions and extracting valuable insights from the reviews.
# Hotel review sentiment analysis
This project focuses on **NLP preprocessing and sentiment analysis** of hotel reviews. Using the NLTK library, stopwords were removed, and frequently occurring words were identified to enhance text refinement. Sentiment analysis was conducted to classify reviews into **positive, negative, and neutral categories**, which were then combined for a holistic evaluation. This analysis aids in understanding guest feedback and deriving valuable insights from the reviews.
